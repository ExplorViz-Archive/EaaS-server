     * *_ALL_PROJECTS authorities, user permissions should be configurable per-project. This means we would have
     * authorities [READ, RUN_BUILD, DELETE_BUILD, MANAGE_SECRETS, MANAGE_COLLABORATORS, DELETE_RPOJECT] each with
     * the project attached to them they are for.
     *
     * Implementing this would require a database table for authorities, a complex UI for user management within the
     * project settings, a user list and maybe even profiles. Therefore, it is out of scope for now.
